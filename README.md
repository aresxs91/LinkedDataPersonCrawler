# LinkedDataPersonCrawler
A custom search engine, running on the DBpedia corpus and built with SPARQL and Apache Jena, demonstrates how crawling and indexing can be executed more efficiently.
The search engine takes as inputs a celebrity's (preferrably) name and their country of origin and will output a list of celebrities most related/associated with them.

# Setup

Build the project using the Maven dependencies and run the Main.java class
